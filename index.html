Dear 3,<br/><br/>Trust me when I say this: it beats the alternative. Life is suffering, that's true. Study a little Buddhism if you really want to understand it. But, that's okay. That's life. Accept the pain. Learn from it, grow from it. Let it enter and pass you through. You will survive. Embrace life.<br/><br/>--AT		<div class="signature">

Turn it to the more you get hurt, the more oppurtunity for you to share your experiences to someone who is hurting too and  YOU are alive for a purpose!! Please seek help if you feel depressed. Some one out there cares and love you!! Be well please! <3		<div class="signature">

Love the body you have. And if it's a gender issue, then go through the change process (it's lengthy), whilst accepting the parts of your body that cannot  be changed.<br/>Some people will not agree. Heck, some will disrespect you. Pay no mind. You do you boo. It's not their body. It's yours. You're the one who's gotta love it and be happy with it, pre or post change.		<div class="signature">

femininity defined by society is a delusion. attraction is strange thing. it does not go by the rules we think we know, pretty much everyone struggles to find someone who is genuinely attracted and  compatible.  I know some of very feminine looking girls still unable to find that someone for a long time. keep the confidence about yourself and someone will find you.   		<div class="signature">

That might be a short term solution but do you really want to say you lived to suffer and all you could do at the end of it was to create more suffering. Instead of overcoming obstacles bettering yourself and actually being able to feel alive, i'd say anyone would want that and i know it is hard but you will make it i believe in you even if the odds are against you even if your parents suck you will prewail and you will become the person you want to be.<br/><br/>                                Much love, take care.		<div class="signature">

We are born loving ourselves and some point along the way, something happens in a small moment that tricks us into thinking this isn't true. Although I can't go back in time to pluck that moment from your pain (as much as I wish), I can tell you that the biggest thing that helped save me was to know that my thoughts can and want to change. There is a place where you will look into the mirror and smile because you will know that you are beautiful and anything otherwise is wrong. May it find you soon as you deserve.

Are you taking it because of gender-affirming therapy? As a new mom, I learned that the hormone is involved with producing milk so my advice is to do what we do and wear nipple pads and use crescent shaped hot/cold pads in your bra to relieve pain. A hot shower or warm wet towl on the area also helps.		<div class="signature">

I'm sorry that you have to go through that experience. I hope that everything works out for you in the end and that you'll be able to get some good sleep soon. My advice is that you should take that situation step by step and try to figure out the possibilities of what could be causing that dream. And then maybe, you'd be able to break out of it! With that, you're doing your best and I'm really proud of you for being persistent! I hope that you'll be able to sleep comfortably soon! <3		<div class="signature">

Hey 3,<br/><br/>I dunno why you feel like that, I dunno why you say that anyway. But if you know what happened to make you feel like that, reflex and deal with it. Sadly, that's the only way to feel better and improve. In case you don't know why that's happening, distract yourself from those thoughts, do whatever your hobbies are, write something, walk outside for a bit. Or... Go to talk to a therapist! It always help, and it did to me! But overall, don't suicide... Please...		<div class="signature">

You don't die if you die in your dream. That's a myth. I think you know that. <br/>You are suffering from depression. Sleeping a long time to escape the real world is a sign. I know dreams are an escape but eventually you'll hit a wall. Your body won't let you live there. I know your very unhappy. You have to live your life. We all do even if at times we don't want to live it. There is no easy answer to make you feel better about life. You only get to live once but you get to not exist forever. There isn't any exit anywhere else. This is all there is.		<div class="signature">

Hey buddy, I've been through similar days, just sleeping and waking up to imagine ways to end me, but that's no way of living, you know you are capable of a lot of things that come in your way, you wouldn't be alive otherwise. Communicate what's happening to you to as many people as you can, so you gets lots of perspectives, don't treat this version of you as the most genuine one, nobody comes into the world wishing to die, is once we get poisoned by negative experiencies that we start to think like that, ask for help, you deserve it.		<div class="signature">

I'm 99% certain there's a link between poor oral hygiene and depression, and it sounds like we're in the same boat. It's been not as bad for me lately, since I've finally started brushing my teeth more often. But there have been weeks, or even months when I would neglect brushing my teeth. Is it safe for me to assume you're still in school? Well, I'm 30, and let me tell you: brush your teeth!

Cleaning non stop for 24 hrs is overkill. If you're old enough to get out of the living situation and have somewhere to stay like friends house then do it asap. I do know that leaving family/house is pretty tough considering everything is getting expensive now but I do hope everything goes well and good luck on buying your hormones. If you have venmo or some other online payment service, I suggest maybe to put it on instagram or tiktok. I don't know much about that but I do know that it has helped some people from ppl donating.		<div class="signature">

Dear 3,<br/><br/>I want you to know that you're not alone in this world. You serve a purpose, regardless of how much you believe it yourself. Things don't remain painful forever, please just trust me on this one, if only this once.

Hey 3,<br/>Sounds like you're feeling undervalued, or like the people in your life don't care about your needs. Everyone I know has felt that way at some point, and it can be really difficult. But I know that you aren't redundant, and I'm certain that the things you have right now aren't a measure of your worth. It might not feel like things will get better, but they will. Be kind to yourself. You are unique and valuable, and someone worth caring for.<br/>Best, J		<div class="signature">

I hear your pain - the world can be terribly confusing and punishing when we don't have the freedom to make our own choices. In a few years, you'll find you can get a job, even if it's boring, and choose whatever you like. The rare things that make you happy will be within your reach! <br/>Some people never get to experience freedom because they never felt what it was like to be without it. Hold out these few years, and you'll find yourself one of the best people, and realise you always were! 		<div class="signature">

I know how this feels, I have had agoraphobia for many years, and it took me a long time to be able to step outside the door alone. I got tired of feeling like my own prisoner and started pushing myself to walk across the street for a coffee, once I was comfortable with that, I started walking a little further and eventually was able to take public transportation.. but That didn't last long, especially during covid.

Hey you! Let me congratulate you, because from what I'm reading here, I suppose you've stepped out of your comfort zone. And that's a really brave thing to do. Being brave is not about never being scared, it's about being scared and doing it anyway. And you're doing it!!! I'm so proud of you. It won't always be easy, but it will make you grow and gain confidence. Life is a bit like a game. Don't take things too seriously. Take the time to see where the beauty is.

I have chronic insomnia and panic disorder, so I resonate with this. I am sorry that you are dealing with that. <br/>Some things that help me are taking a bath, listening to calming music and breathing along to the rhythm, and drinking a warm cup of decaf tea. Some other things that might help are guided meditation and journaling. A lot of anxiety and nervousness comes from overthinking. It can help to get those thoughts on paper so you can clearly see them, rather than having them aimlessly float around in your mind.		<div class="signature">

This could also be a good opportunity for you! The world of work is very difficult to access at the moment. If you can,  ask a friend or a family member to go with you so that you are not out alone. If you are employed, try to make contacts with colleagues to go out together, it is also a good opportunity for a walk. Of course, if your physical or mental health doesn't allow it, don't force your body to exceed its limits. Take care of yourself.

Wanting to work to live and not live to work can be a hard balance to strike up in life. I know grinding for so little money can be a struggle but hopefully as time passes you are able to make more!

Hello 3!<br/>It's hard when parents don't accept your gender identity (I'm non-binary and understand the pain and struggle). The important thing is that YOU know you're a woman. It will be a struggle living under the same roof with an unsupporting parent, but try to push through until you move out, then you can buy the clothes you want!

3,<br/>Sometimes people will never admit that their way of thinking is harmful. However, if she still cares about you, I am sure you can change her mind. Show her that there are others, kind people who are going through the same thing, who just want to be accepted. But in the event that she still does not accept you, try to keep a level head and prove her wrong through your actions. I wish you the best. Take care.		<div class="signature">

Dear 3,<br/><br/>It's understandable to not bear our own reflection when the person we see within a camera or mirror is something we despise deeply.

Hello dear!<br/>Life can be hard. Even simple tasks may seem to huge to handle at times. Growing older, I realized it's fine if you need help. Not everyone can to everything, and that's totally fine! A lot of people mostly pretend they really accomplish everything, but after all, everyone needs someone from time to time. And sometimes, all you need is a "mama" to hug you, tell you it's fine and help you get things going.<br/>So, never be afraid to ask for help.

Same. I'm a grown person who has no skills and hates housechores. I don't even like to cook. But, yeah, you have to remember that you have learned stuff through the years, stuff that makes you happy, stuff that you like to do, stuff that even though they won't make you rich fulfill a need inside you. Remember those and do those. Find your happiness. Find your passion. Hope it works out for the both of us. Hugs.		<div class="signature">

Hey, 3. For whatever it's worth, I've been there. Sometimes because of heartbreak; mostly because I felt like I had no one to love or to love me back. I spent years in  that hole. But if it matters anything at all, I have found the love of my life, and we're knee-deep spending the rest of our lives together. It didn't come easy, and it certainly didn't come on its own. I actively sought out love (mostly via Tinder/Happn), and it led to a lot of pain and sadness. In the end, I think that's part of what sharpens you to understand and accept happiness when you find it.		<div class="signature">

You're grieving something. Sadness and anger are two of the five stages of grief (look up Elizabeth Kubler-Ross). But it sounds like you're not able to grieve through the other stages to acceptance. Maybe take a look at what you might be grieving, and why you're unable to complete it? I hope you're able to understand what's happening to you.		<div class="signature">

they say you can't actually feel sadness and anger at the same time because it travels through the same roadpath in our brains. dunno where i read that from a while ago. and i can definitely relate to all three. i think we have to have a sense of humor about life or else we'd go crazy. just wanted to say i feel you and that you're not alone.		<div class="signature">

I have had suicidal feelings in the past and in that respect I can understand how hard it can be to deal with though I can't possibly know exactly what you're going through right now. One thing I realised was that killing myself was'nt the answer, the pain doesnt end because you stop living that just passes it on to someone else. The people who love you, or who are connected to you in some form. The ripples can be extensive. I know its hard but I would highly suggest you see a doctor who can advise you so much better than I could. -s		<div class="signature">

Sorry to hear you're having a hard time mate.  Please contact a crisis line because it sounds like you really need some help getting through this.<br/>As some general advice from a non-expert, you may not feel like your face/body is yours, and you may hate it but it's still the best peice of equipment that you'll ever own.  Take good care of it, whatever form it's in.  If you could buy a vehicle that could do everything your body can do, it'd be worth a million.<br/><br/>All the best, friend		<div class="signature">

I'm sorry to hear that you are in so much pain. Do you have body dysmorphic disorder? Putting it simply, that's when you see flaws in your body that other people don't see. There is treatment for it, so you can feel more comfortable i your body.<br/><br/>Or maybe you feel like you are trans? I can't really tell from your letter, but whether you have BDD or are trans, there are still ways to be happy. I hope you can find them. Please take care of yourself.		<div class="signature">

Beautiful Lady, If your heart and soul say you are female.. You are female. <br/>..I cannot begin to imagine what you have been going through, how unsupported you are and how lost you feel.. But know that the whole world isn't as small as the minds of those around you, as dark as the rooms you lock yourself in, nor as deafening as the voices in your mind are. Where there is darkness, there must always be light. Darkness is not always to evil as light is to goodness. Keep fighting the good fight Queen.  <3xX,..Raye		<div class="signature">

Hey you. I think I've read about three messages from you. I am pretty sure it's the same person. I'm now piecing together your story.<br/><br/>Listen, I know I can't change how you feel about yourself and your appearance. I just happen to be a pansexual male. I want you to know there are people out there who don't care how you look.<br/><br/>I really hope you can feel the same way about yourself. As always, I'll be thinking about you.		<div class="signature">

Death is never the answer. I understand the tempation, probably too well... but it will only hurt your loved ones.<br/>You are NOT a monster for taking hormones or trying to change yourself. Did you know that most post-menopause women also take hormones? Are they monsters...? No. They are just trying to be who they feel like - "Still in my 20s, with the wind in my hair!"<br/>Please be whoever you want to be, and find those who will accept you. Someone will miss you. Someone will mourn, and be hurt by your absence. You are vital.		<div class="signature">

Hewwo!<br/>I'm guessing you're a trans person as well coming from the wording of your thoughts.<br/>I've been openly living as the person i am for almost 5 years now and it has been an up and down ride. People accept you, others despise you, and again others try too hard to accept you.<br/>People are hard, but the love i have for you on your path to become the person that you ARE is immeasurable. I love you, keep going, you're a beautiful being worthy of everything good.		<div class="signature">

And i am replying to this text as well. Calm down man. <br/>Why do you want to BE a female? are you a FEMALE ? concerned about looks ? then work on it<br/><br/>Are you a male ? Then quit trying to be something you are not. See the good you have in you and be you<br/><br/>Either way, ending yourself means you miss out on all of your good days man		<div class="signature">

Then don't see yourself. Close your eyes, and FEEL yourself. <br/>Focus on the things that make you feel like a female, do the things that you find feminine. <br/>I don't know why you hate yourself. But would you rather be someone else? The people you want to be, have worse flaws than you think you have, trust me, i have been there. <br/>So small steps, okay ? baby steps. One piece at a time, you can rebuild yourself. You got this, i believe in you - (K135)		<div class="signature">

I feel like you need to take a deep breath. You did it? Now breathe out. :)<br/>We all tend to focus on our own bad points, things we want to change.<br/>Try to now focus on something you do like about yourself. Maybe you can sing? Draw? Make people laugh? I'm 100% sure there's something!<br/>You say you don't like your features, but maybe you still need time to grow into them?<br/>Please take it from me, a joyful heart is good medicine, try to focus on good things. :) I'm sure you're wonderful!		<div class="signature">

I am unsure if you are trans, or just a more masculine presenting female, but I can say I understand your feelings a bit. I was born with very high testosterone levels, so I have a lot of body hair, a more masuline physique, and I despise my body. I hate looking at myself. Because of this, I try to not focus on how I look. I don't look into mirrors very often and I focus mostly on who I am as a person. On the things that make me me and the things I like. Because, in the end, I will lose this body, but I will always have myself.		<div class="signature">
